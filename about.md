![Me!]({{"/assets/dataengconf_photo.jpg" | absolute_url}})

I am an applied statistician, originally from Melbourne, Australia, and currently in NYC. I am Director of Data Science at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropy. Before that, I was head of data science at frontier 
markets debt platform startup [Lendable](http://lendablemarketplace.io).

Previously, I worked at 

- [The Data Science for Social Good fellowship at U Chicago](dssg.uchicago.edu) on uplift/attribution estimation for the Obamacare outreach effort in Illinois and across the US.
- [The Grattan Institute](grattan.edu.au), mostly on Superannuation policy, including fees, manager performance, mechanism design, and taxation. 
- [The Australian Treasury](treasury.gov.au) in the macroeconometrics modeling unit, and in the CGE modeling team on the (late) 2011 carbon tax. 
- At the Penny Farthing Bicycle Shop, selling and repairing bicycles. To date, it has been my longest period of continuous employment. 

I studied economics/econometrics at universities of Melbourne (MEc) and La Trobe (BEc H1).
