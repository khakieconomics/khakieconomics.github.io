I don't always have time to write up a full blog on a modeling topic (or haven't gotten to it yet). When that happens, I'll often put up a pair of files on Gist, one in Stan, one in R. The Stan file contains the model implmentation, while the R file will simulate some fake data and run it. 

**Heckman Correction in Stan**

[R file](https://gist.github.com/khakieconomics/423825e2b83c448d95b5f7198b532fdd)

**B-spline in Stan**
